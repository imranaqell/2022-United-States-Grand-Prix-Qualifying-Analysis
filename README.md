# 2022 United States Grand Prix Qualifying Analysis

**Introduction**

Round 19 has come and it has been serving us with some raw entertainment. A few hours earlier, Sainz had won pole by a mere half-tenth of a second over his teammate, Leclerc. Following close behind is 2022 World Champion, Max Verstappen. The gap between those three was within a tenth of a second. It is indeed amazing to see how different engineering designs can have nearly identical performance. Formula 1 is indeed the greatest sport to ever exist.

**Analysis**

An analysis was done to find the times lost and gained in each and every part of the track. I compared the speed, amount of throttle, and amount of brakes in each sector of the infamous Circuits of America in my analysis. Each of the three top contenders has a different style of driving and also different car behaviour to match the driving style of the elite drivers. In an analysis like this, we are able to see the difference, such as who applied the throttle earlier when exiting a corner.
